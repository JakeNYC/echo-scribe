#Echo Scribe

###Make meetings less painful.

Ever had a meeting, when you forgot the key points, got off topic, or somebody was missing?<br />
Echo Scribe listens to your meeting and transcribes who says what.<br />
This makes meetings clear, concise, actionable, and hopefully happen less.<br />

To run server locally: DEBUG=echoscribe_service:* npm start
